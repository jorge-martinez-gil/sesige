## üåü Overview

Semantic similarity measures play a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This repository accompanies the paper [**"Automatic Design of Semantic Similarity Ensembles Using Grammatical Evolution"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00925), which introduces a **Grammatical Evolution (GE)-based framework** for **automatic design and optimization of semantic similarity ensembles**. The proposed method enables the dynamic creation of highly accurate and interpretable ensembles, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark datasets.

## ‚ú® Key Contributions

- **Novel Application of Grammatical Evolution**: First use of GE for designing semantic similarity ensembles.
- **Dynamic Aggregation**: Combines multiple similarity measures to create optimized ensembles.
- **Interpretable and Accurate**: Balances high performance with model interpretability.
- **Benchmark Comparisons**: Demonstrates superiority over existing ensemble methods on MC30 and GeReSiD50 datasets.

## üìä Features

- Automated generation of semantic similarity ensembles guided by Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar.
- Support for correlation-based optimization using Pearson and Spearman metrics.
- Integration with the **PonyGE2** framework for evolutionary computation.
- Results validated on standard datasets: **MC30** and **GeReSiD50**.
